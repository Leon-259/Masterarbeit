@article{Bewley.2016,
 abstract = {This paper explores a pragmatic approach to multiple object tracking where the main focus is to associate objects efficiently for online and realtime applications. To this end, detection quality is identified as a key factor influencing tracking performance, where changing the detector can improve tracking by up to 18.9{\%}. Despite only using a rudimentary combination of familiar techniques such as the Kalman Filter and Hungarian algorithm for the tracking components, this approach achieves an accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art online trackers. Furthermore, due to the simplicity of our tracking method, the tracker updates at a rate of 260 Hz which is over 20x faster than other state-of-the-art trackers.},

@article{Chen.2023,
 abstract = {Chicken is a major source of dietary protein worldwide. The dispersion and movement of chickens constitute vital indicators of their health and status. This is especially evident in Taiwanese native chickens (TNCs), a local variety which is high in physical activity when healthy. Conventionally, the dispersion and movement of chicken flocks are observed in patrols. However, manual patrolling is laborious and time-consuming. Moreover, frequent patrols increase the risk of carrying pathogens into chicken farms. To address these issues, this study proposes an approach to develop an automatic warning system for anomalous dispersion and movement of chicken flocks in commercial chicken farms. Embendded systems were developed to acquire videos of chickens from overhead view in a chicken house, in which approximately 20,000 TNCs were raised for a period of 10 wk. Each video was 5-min in length. The videos were transmitted to a remote cloud server and were converted into images. A You Only Look Once-version 7 tiny (YOLOv7-tiny) object detection model was trained to detect chickens in the images. The dispersion of the chicken flocks in a 5-min long video was calculated using nearest neighbor index (NNI). The movement of the chicken flocks in a 5-min long video was quantified using simple online and real-time tracking algorithm (SORT). The normal ranges (i.e., 95{\%} confidence intervals) of chicken dispersion and movement were established using an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors (SARIMAX) model, respectively. The system allows farmers to check up on the chicken farm only when the dispersion or movement values were not in the normal ranges. Thus, labor time can be saved and the risk of carrying pathogens into chicken farms can be reduced. The trained YOLOv7-tiny model achieved an average precision of 98.2{\%} in chicken detection. SORT achieved a multiple object tracking accuracy of 95.3{\%}. The ARIMA and SARIMAX achieved a mean absolute percentage error 3.71{\%} and 13.39{\%}, respectively, in forecasting dispersion and movement. The proposed approach can serve as a solution for automatic monitoring of anomalous chicken dispersion and movement in chicken farming, alerting farmers of potential health risks and environmental hazards in chicken farms.},

 abstract = {Standardized benchmarks have been crucial in pushing the performance of computer vision algorithms, especially since the advent of deep learning. Although leaderboards should not be over-claimed, they often provide the most objective measure of performance and are therefore important guides for research. We present MOTChallenge, a benchmark for single-camera Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) launched in late 2014, to collect existing and new data, and create a framework for the standardized evaluation of multiple object tracking methods. The benchmark is focused on multiple people tracking, since pedestrians are by far the most studied object in the tracking community, with applications ranging from robot navigation to self-driving cars. This paper collects the first three releases of the benchmark: (i) MOT15, along with numerous state-of-the-art results that were submitted in the last years, (ii) MOT16, which contains new challenging videos, and (iii) MOT17, that extends MOT16 sequences with more precise labels and evaluates tracking performance on three different object detectors. The second and third release not only offers a significant increase in the number of labeled boxes but also provide labels for multiple object classes beside pedestrians, as well as the level of visibility for every single object of interest. We finally provide a categorization of state-of-the-art trackers and a broad error analysis. This will help newcomers understand the related work and research trends in the MOT community, and hopefully shed some light on potential future research directions.

Algorithms increasingly run our lives. They find books, movies, jobs, and dates for us, manage our investments, and discover new drugs. More and more, these algorithms work by learning from the trails of data we leave in our newly digital world. Like curious children, they observe us, imitate, and experiment.

 abstract = {With the continuous and vast increase in the amount of data in our digital world, it has been acknowledged that the number of knowledgeable data scientists can not scale to address these challenges. Thus, there was a crucial need for automating the process of building good machine learning models. In the last few years, several techniques and frameworks have been introduced to tackle the challenge of automating the process of Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyper-parameter tuning (CASH) in the machine learning domain. The main aim of these techniques is to reduce the role of the human in the loop and fill the gap for non-expert machine learning users by playing the role of the domain expert.

In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey for the state-of-the-art efforts in tackling the CASH problem. In addition, we highlight the research work of automating the other steps of the full complex machine learning pipeline (AutoML) from data understanding till model deployment. Furthermore, we provide comprehensive coverage for the various tools and frameworks that have been introduced in this domain. Finally, we discuss some of the research directions and open challenges that need to be addressed in order to achieve the vision and goals of the AutoML process.},

@misc{Feng.2022,
 abstract = {Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is one of the most fundamental computer vision tasks that contributes to various video analysis applications. Despite the recent promising progress, current MOT research is still limited to a fixed sampling frame rate of the input stream. In fact, we empirically found that the accuracy of all recent state-of-the-art trackers drops dramatically when the input frame rate changes. For a more intelligent tracking solution, we shift the attention of our research work to the problem of Frame Rate Agnostic MOT (FraMOT), which takes frame rate insensitivity into consideration. In this paper, we propose a Frame Rate Agnostic MOT framework with a Periodic training Scheme (FAPS) to tackle the FraMOT problem for the first time. Specifically, we propose a Frame Rate Agnostic Association Module (FAAM) that infers and encodes the frame rate information to aid identity matching across multi-frame-rate inputs, improving the capability of the learned model in handling complex motion-appearance relations in FraMOT. Moreover, the association gap between training and inference is enlarged in FraMOT because those post-processing steps not included in training make a larger difference in lower frame rate scenarios. To address it, we propose Periodic Training Scheme (PTS) to reflect all post-processing steps in training via tracking pattern matching and fusion. Along with the proposed approaches, we make the first attempt to establish an evaluation method for this new task of FraMOT in two different modes, i.e., known frame rate and unknown frame rate, aiming to handle a more complex situation. The quantitative experiments on the challenging MOT17/20 dataset (FraMOT version) have clearly demonstrated that the proposed approaches can handle different frame rates better and thus improve the robustness against complicated scenarios.},

To address this, we present a novel MOT evaluation metric, HOTA (Higher Order Tracking Accuracy), which explicitly balances the effect of performing accurate detection, association and localization into a single unified metric for comparing trackers. HOTA decomposes into a family of sub-metrics which are able to evaluate each of five basic error types separately, which enables clear analysis of tracking performance. We evaluate the effectiveness of HOTA on the MOTChallenge benchmark, and show that it is able to capture important aspects of MOT performance not previously taken into account by established metrics. Furthermore, we show HOTA scores better align with human visual evaluation of tracking performance.},

 abstract = {Common benchmark data sets, standardized performance metrics, and baseline algorithms have demonstrated considerable impact on research and development in a variety of application domains. These resources provide both consumers and developers of technology with a common framework to objectively compare the performance of different algorithms and algorithmic improvements. In this paper, we present such a framework for evaluating object detection and tracking in video: specifically for face, text, and vehicle objects. This framework includes the source video data, ground-truth annotations (along with guidelines for annotation), performance metrics, evaluation protocols, and tools including scoring software and baseline algorithms. For each detection and tracking task and supported domain, we developed a 50-clip training set and a 50-clip test set. Each data clip is approximately 2.5 minutes long and has been completely spatially/temporally annotated at the I-frame level. Each task/domain, therefore, has an associated annotated corpus of approximately 450,000 frames. The scope of such annotation is unprecedented and was designed to begin to support the necessary quantities of data for robust machine learning approaches, as well as a statistically significant comparison of the performance of algorithms. The goal of this work was to systematically address the challenges of object detection and tracking through a common evaluation framework that permits a meaningful objective comparison of techniques, provides the research community with sufficient data for the exploration of automatic modeling techniques, encourages the incorporation of objective evaluation into the development process, and contributes useful lasting resources of a scale and magnitude that will prove to be extremely useful to the computer vision research community for years to come.},

Finding no consensus, we present survey responses from 174 members of three behaviour-focused scientific societies as to their understanding of the term.

Respondents contradict themselves, each other, and published definitions, indicating that they are using individually variable intuitive, rather than codified, meanings of `behaviour.' We offer a new definition, based largely on survey responses: {\textquotedbl}Behaviour is the internally coordinated responses (actions or inactions) of whole living organisms (individuals or groups) to internal and/or external stimuli, excluding responses more easily understood as developmental changes.{\textquotedbl} Finally, we discuss the usage, meanings and limitations of this definition.},

Although different approaches have been proposed to tackle this problem, it still remains challenging due to factors like abrupt appearance changes and severe object occlusions. In this work, we contribute the first comprehensive and most recent review on this problem. We inspect the recent advances in various aspects and propose some interesting directions for future research. To the best of our knowledge, there has not been any extensive review on this topic in the community. We endeavor to provide a thorough review on the development of this problem in recent decades. The main contributions of this review are fourfold: 1) Key aspects in an MOT system, including formulation, categorization, key principles, evaluation of MOT are discussed; 2) Instead of enumerating individual works, we discuss existing approaches according to various aspects, in each of which methods are divided into different groups and each group is discussed in detail for the principles, advances and drawbacks; 3) We examine experiments of existing publications and summarize results on popular datasets to provide quantitative and comprehensive comparisons. By analyzing the results from different perspectives, we have verified some basic agreements in the field; and 4) We provide a discussion about issues of MOT research, as well as some interesting directions which will become potential research effort in the future.

Such systems can be used in many sensitive environments to make important and life-changing decisions; thus, it is crucial to ensure that the decisions do not reflect discriminatory behavior toward certain groups or populations. We have recently seen work in machine learning, natural language processing, and deep learning that addresses such challenges in different subdomains. With the commercialization of these systems, researchers are becoming aware of the biases that these applications can contain and have attempted to address them. In this survey we investigated different real-world applications that have shown biases in various ways, and we listed different sources of biases that can affect AI applications. We then created a taxonomy for fairness definitions that machine learning researchers have defined in order to avoid the existing bias in AI systems. In addition to that, we examined different domains and subdomains in AI showing what researchers have observed with regard to unfair outcomes in the state-of-the-art methods and how they have tried to address them. There are still many future directions and solutions that can be taken to mitigate the problem of bias in AI systems. We are hoping that this survey will motivate researchers to tackle these issues in the near future by observing existing work in their respective fields.},

Despite potential pitfalls of such benchmarks, they have proved to be extremely helpful to advance the state of the art in the respective area. Interestingly, there has been rather limited work on the standardization of quantitative benchmarks for multiple target tracking. One of the few exceptions is the well-known PETS dataset, targeted primarily at surveillance applications. Despite being widely used, it is often applied inconsistently, for example involving using different subsets of the available data, different ways of training the models, or differing evaluation scripts. This paper describes our work toward a novel multiple object tracking benchmark aimed to address such issues. We discuss the challenges of creating such a framework, collecting existing and new data, gathering state-of-the-art methods to be tested on the datasets, and finally creating a unified evaluation system. With MOTChallenge we aim to pave the way toward a unified evaluation framework for a more meaningful quantification of multi-target tracking.},

Recently, a new benchmark for Multiple Object Tracking, MOTChallenge, was launched with the goal of collecting existing and new data and creating a framework for the standardized evaluation of multiple object tracking methods. The first release of the benchmark focuses on multiple people tracking, since pedestrians are by far the most studied object in the tracking community. This paper accompanies a new release of the MOTChallenge benchmark. Unlike the initial release, all videos of MOT16 have been carefully annotated following a consistent protocol. Moreover, it not only offers a significant increase in the number of labeled boxes, but also provides multiple object classes beside pedestrians and the level of visibility for every single object of interest.

The challenge focuses on multiple people tracking, since pedestrians are well studied in the tracking community, and precise tracking and detection has high practical relevance. Since the first release, MOT15, MOT16, and MOT17 have tremendously contributed to the community by introducing a clean dataset and precise framework to benchmark multi-object trackers. In this paper, we present our MOT20benchmark, consisting of 8 new sequences depicting very crowded challenging scenes. The benchmark was presented first at the 4thBMTT MOT Challenge Workshop at the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference (CVPR) 2019, and gives to chance to evaluate state-of-the-art methods for multiple object tracking when handling extremely crowded scenarios.

The sequences of the new MOT20 benchmark were previously presented in the CVPR 2019 tracking challenge ( arXiv:1906.04567 ). The differences between the two challenges are: - New and corrected annotations - New sequences, as we had to crop and transform some old sequences to achieve higher quality in the annotations. - New baselines evaluations and different sets of public detections},

 abstract = {Heart Disease has become one of the most serious diseases that has a significant impact on human life. It has emerged as one of the leading causes of mortality among the people across the globe during the last decade. In order to prevent patients from further damage, an accurate diagnosis of heart disease on time is an essential factor. Recently we have seen the usage of non-invasive medical procedures, such as artificial intelligence-based techniques in the field of medical. Specially machine learning employs several algorithms and techniques that are widely used and are highly useful in accurately diagnosing the heart disease with less amount of time. However, the prediction of heart disease is not an easy task. The increasing size of medical datasets has made it a complicated task for practitioners to understand the complex feature relations and make disease predictions. Accordingly, the aim of this research is to identify the most important risk-factors from a highly dimensional dataset which helps in the accurate classification of heart disease with less complications. For a broader analysis, we have used two heart disease datasets with various medical features. The classification results of the benchmarked models proved that there is a high impact of relevant features on the classification accuracy. Even with a reduced number of features, the performance of the classification models improved significantly with a reduced training time as compared with models trained on full feature set.

@book{ShalevShwartz.2014,
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}Machine learning is one of the fastest growing areas of computer science, with far-reaching applications. The aim of this textbook is to introduce machine learning, and the algorithmic paradigms it offers, in a principled way. The book provides an extensive theoretical account of the fundamental ideas underlying machine learning and the mathematical derivations that transform these principles into practical algorithms. Following a presentation of the basics of the field, the book covers a wide array of central topics that have not been addressed by previous textbooks. These include a discussion of the computational complexity of learning and the concepts of convexity and stability; important algorithmic paradigms including stochastic gradient descent, neural networks, and structured output learning; and emerging theoretical concepts such as the PAC-Bayes approach and compression-based bounds. Designed for an advanced undergraduate or beginning graduate course, the text makes the fundamentals and algorithms of machine learning accessible to students and non-expert readers in statistics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering{\textquotedbl}--},

@misc{Sutton.2010-11-17,
 abstract = {Often we wish to predict a large number of variables that depend on each other as well as on other observed variables. Structured prediction methods are essentially a combination of classification and graphical modeling, combining the ability of graphical models to compactly model multivariate data with the ability of classification methods to perform prediction using large sets of input features. This tutorial describes conditional random fields, a popular probabilistic method for structured prediction. CRFs have seen wide application in natural language processing, computer vision, and bioinformatics. We describe methods for inference and parameter estimation for CRFs, including practical issues for implementing large scale CRFs. We do not assume previous knowledge of graphical modeling, so this tutorial is intended to be useful to practitioners in a wide variety of fields.},
